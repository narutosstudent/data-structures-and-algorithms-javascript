# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure.

Dynamic programming in itself isn't difficult. The difficult part is figuring out how to turn the problem into subproblems so that you can apply dynamic programming to it.
